### Course Learn Retrieval Augmented Generation

This repository contains the Hoopla project used throughout the Boot.dev RAG course. It includes a simple keyword search CLI and a minimal inverted index.

Quick start:
- Run a search: `python -m hoopla.cli.keyword_search_cli search "your query"`
- Save an index with pickle (stdlib): see hoopla/README.md for a short example.
